Small side project to learn how something like React works, the name comes from just going with the opposite of reacting, halting.

The API is composed of a small subset of what React has, in this case the two more important pieces, useState and useEffect.

#### How to use

To test it you can simply `git clone` it and install the dependencies.

- So `git clone git@github.com:AlexGPlay/Halt.git`
- Go into the folder and `npm install`
- `npm run dev` and enjoy it in `localhost:8080`

The library itself is in `halt/src` and the example that is running on the webpack dev server is in `halt/example`.
